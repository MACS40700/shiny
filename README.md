# Shiny app development

## There are three levels of engagement that we will explore -- the most basic, low-intermediate, and (somewhat) intermediate-intermediate

### Basic
* **[sandbox](sandbox)**: this has our basic file structure for starting fresh
  * app.R (empty script file)

### Intermediate
* **[age-rule](age-rule)**: pre-written very simple script file to check age
  *app.R pre-written script file
  
### Intermediate-Intermediate
* **[baby-names](baby-names)**: looking at baby-name data
  * app.R pre-written more-involved script file that allows for menu with multi-page access
  * baby_names.rds: r data structure (more efficient with space for data)
  * combining-data.R: script that demonstrates how the data were obtained (raw data not included for space reasons)
  * README.md: readme file for this sub-project with attribution
  * custom.css: custom file for colors and formatting
